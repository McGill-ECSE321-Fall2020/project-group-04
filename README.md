# ECSE 321 Online Art Gallery - Fall 2020 - Group 4
Welcome to group 4's Online Art Gallery!
  
**Project scope**:
  The goal of this project is to provide an online platform for a local art gallery. Any logged in user may choose to purchase listed artwork and pay online. Users may also choose to create an artist profile and list their artwork for sale. The gallery itself may also choose to promote certain pieces of art. This gallery is available on two frontends: a website and an application.
